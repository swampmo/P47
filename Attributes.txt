This model and many systems were already made by Syd Adams, I have converted the FDM to JSBsim andded gauges and made it combat capable without bambable using OPRF code.
Much thanks to Pinto and to Nikolai Verner Christensen for help with making this a working combat model and also helping with FDM and UV mapping. Thanks to 5H1N0B1 for help to make a working livery system. This has been my first major project although it may seem small to some developers but it is a contiuing process. Thanks to Enrico Castaldi for making liveries. 

To do:
FDM
3D modeling 
Advanced systems
